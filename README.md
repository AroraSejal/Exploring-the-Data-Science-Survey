# Exploring-the-Data-Science-Survey

When beginning a career in data science, one often wonders what programming tools and languages are being used in the industry, and what skills one should learn first. By exploring the 2017 Kaggle Data Science Survey results, you can learn about the tools used by 10,000+ people in the professional data science community.

In this project, we are going to find out what tools and languages professionals use in their day-to-day work. Our data comes from the Kaggle Data Science Survey which includes responses from over 10,000 people that write code to analyze data in their daily work.
